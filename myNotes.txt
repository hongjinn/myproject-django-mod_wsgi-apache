# To start building your website, first make a new virtual environment for each separate machine
# that you will do development on. This is why venv/ is in .gitignore
# Also call it "venv" since mod_wsgi for apache2 will call out "venv" in the config files
# Just run these commands from the "myproject" root directory folder

# Let's create a virtual environment
pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 venv

# You can also use this command to create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv               # Creates a venv called "venv"

# Now let's activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
